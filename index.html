    <h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>The focus of this chapter is on three fundamental questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What assets do we need to protect?</li>
      <li>How are those assets threatened?</li>
      <li>What can we do to counter those threats?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="11-computer-security-concepts">1.1 Computer Security Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Computer Security</em> definition is: measures and controls that
      ensure <em>confidentiality</em>, <em>integrity</em> and
      <em>availability</em> of information system assets including hardware,
      software, firmware and information being processed, store and
      communicated.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Confidentiality</em>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Data confidentiality</em>: assures that private or confidential
            information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized
            individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Privacy</em>: assures that individual control or influence what
            information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom
            and to whom that information may be disclosed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Integrity</em>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Data integrity</em>: assures that information and programs are
            changed only in a specified and authorized manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>System integrity</em>: assures that a system performs its
            intended function in a unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or
            inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Availability</em>: assures that systems work promptly and service is
        not denied to authorized users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These three concepts form the <em>CIA triad</em>. The three concepts
      embody the fundamental security objectives for both data and for
      information and computing services.<br />
      FIPS199 provides a useful characterization of these three objectives in
      terms of requirements and the definition of a loss of security in each
      category:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Confidentiality</em>: preserving authorized restrictions on
        information access and disclosure, including means for protecting
        personal privacy and proprietary information. A loss of confidentiality
        is the unauthorized disclosure of information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Integrity</em>: guarding against improper information modification
        or destruction, including ensuring information nonrepudation and
        authenticity. A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or
        destruction of information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Availability</em>: ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of
        information. A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or
        use of information or an information system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additional concepts are needed to present a complete picture. Two of the
      most commonly mentioned are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Authenticity</em>: the property of being genuine and being able to
        be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a
        message, or message originator. This means verifying that users are who
        they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a
        trusted source.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Accountability</em>: the security goal that generates the
        requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that
        entity. This supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation,
        intrusion detection and prevention, and after-action recovery and legal
        action. Because truly secure systems are not yet an achievable goal, we
        must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party. Systems
        must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis
        to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that FIPS 199 includes authenticity under integrity.</p>
    <h4 id="levels-of-impact">Levels of impact</h4>
    <p>
      We use three levels of impact on organizations or individuals, that are
      defined in FIPS 199:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Low</em>: the loss could be expected to have a limited adverse
        effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
        individuals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Moderate</em>: the loss could be expected to have a serious adverse
        effect on organization operations, organizational assets, or
        individuals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>High</em>: the loss could be expected to have a severe or
        catastrophic adverse effect on organization operations, organizational
        assets, or individuals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="the-challenges-of-computer-security">
      The challenges of computer security
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Most of the major requirements for security services can be given
        self-explanatory one-word labels: confidentiality, authentication,
        nonrepudiation, and integrity.
      </li>
      <li>
        In developing a particular security mechanism or algorithm, one must
        always consider potential attacks on those security features.
      </li>
      <li>
        The procedures used to provide particular services are often
        counterintuitive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Having designed various security mechanisms, it is necessary to decide
        where to use them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security mechanisms typically involve more than a particular algorithm
        or protocol. They also require that participants be in possession of
        some secret information, which raises questions about the creation,
        distribution and protection of that secret information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Computer security is essentially a battle of wits between a perpetrator
        who tries to find holes and the designer who tries to close them.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a natural tendency to perceive little benefit from security
        investment until a security failure occurs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security requires regular, even constant monitoring, and this is
        difficult in today's short-term, overloaded environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security is still too often an afterthought to be incorporated into a
        system after the design is complete, rather than being an integral part
        of the design process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users view strong security as an impediment to efficient and
        user-friendly operation of a system.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="a-model-for-computer-security">A model for computer security</h4>
    <p>The assets of a computer system can be categorized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hardware;</li>
      <li>Software;</li>
      <li>Data;</li>
      <li>
        Communication facilities and networks: Local and wide area network
        communication links, bridges, routers, and so on.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the context of security, out concern is with the vulnerabilities of
      system resources. They can be listed in general categories as this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The system can be corrupted, so it does the wrong thing or gives wrong
        answers.
      </li>
      <li>The system can become leaky.</li>
      <li>The system can become unavailable or very slow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These three general types of vulnerability correspond to the CIA concepts.
      Corresponding to the various types of vulnerabilities to a system resource
      are <em>threats</em> that are capable of exploiting those vulnerabilities.
      A threat represents a potential security harm to an asset. An attack is a
      threat that is carried out and, if successful, leads to an undesirable
      violation of security, or threat consequence. The agent carrying out the
      attack is referred as <em>threat agent</em>. We can distinguish two types
      of attacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Active attack: an attempt to alter system resources or affect their
        operation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Passive attack: an attempt to learn or make use of information from the
        system that does not affect system resources.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can also classify attacks based on the origin of the attack:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inside attack: initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Outside attack: initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized
        or illegitimate user of the system.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, a <em>countermeasure</em> is any means taken to deal with a
      security attack. Ideally, a countermeasure can be devised to prevent a
      particular type of attack from succeeding. When prevention is not
      possible, or fails in some instance, the goal is to detect the attack then
      recover from the effects of the attack.

    <h4 id="threats-and-attacks">Threats and Attacks</h4>
    <p>
      RFC 4949 describes four kinds of threat consequences and lists the kinds
      of attacks that result in each consequence.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unauthorized disclosure is a threat to confidentiality. A circumstance
        or event whereby an entity gains access to data for which the entity is
        not authorized. The following types of attacks can result in this threat
        consequence:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Exposure: sensitive data are directly released to an unauthorized
            entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interception: an unauthorized entity directly accesses sensitive
            data traveling between authorized sources and destinations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inference: a threat action whereby an unauthorized entity indirectly
            accesses sensitive data (but not necessarily the data contained in
            the communication) by reasoning from characteristics or by-products
            of communications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intrusion: an unauthorized entity gains access to sensitive data by
            circumventing a system's security protections.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Deception is a threat to either system integrity or data integrity. A
        circumstance or event that may result in an authorized entity receiving
        false data and believing it to be true. The following types of attacks
        can result in this threat consequence:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Masquerade: an unauthorized entity gains access to a system or
            performs a malicious act by posing as an authorized entity.
          </li>
          <li>Falsification: false data deceive an authorized entity.</li>
          <li>
            Repudiation: an entity deceives another by falsely denying
            responsibility for an act.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Disruption is a threat to availability or system integrity. A
        circumstance or event that interrupts or prevents the correct operation
        of system services and functions. The following types of attacks can
        result in this threat consequence:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Incapacitation: prevents or interrupts system operation by disabling
            a system component.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corruption: undesirably alters system operation by adversely
            modifyng system functions or data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Obstruction: a threat action that interrupts delivery of system
            services by hindering system operation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Usurpation is a threat to system integrity. A circumstance or event that
        results in control of system services or functions by an unauthorized
        entity. The following types of attacks can result in this threat
        consequence:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Misappropriation: an entity assumes unauthorized logical or
            pyhysical control of a system resource.
          </li>
          <li>
            Misuse: causes a system component to perform a function or service
            that is detrimental to system security.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="threats-and-assets">Threats and Assets</h4>
    <p>
      The assets of a computer system can be categorized as hardware, software,
      data and communication lines and networks.
    </p>
    <h5 id="hardware">Hardware</h5>
    <p>
      A major threat to computer system hardware is the threat to availability.
      Hardware is the most vulnerable to attack and the least susceptible to
      automated controls.
    </p>
    <h5 id="software">Software</h5>
    <p>
      Software includes the operating system, utilities and application
      programs. A key threat to software is an attack on availability.
    </p>
    <h5 id="data">Data</h5>
    <p>
      Hardware and software security are typically concerns of computing center
      professionals or individual concerns of personal computer users. A much
      more widespread problem is data security, which involves files and other
      forms of data controlled by individuals, groups and business
      organizations. Security concerns with respect to data are broad,
      encompassing availability, secrecy and integrity. In the case of
      availability, the concern is with the destruction of data files, which can
      occur either accidentally or maliciously. The obvious concern with secrecy
      is the unauthorized reading of data files or databases. A less obvious
      threat to secrecy involves the analysis of data and manifests itself in
      the use of so-called statistical databases, which provide summary or
      aggregate information.<br />
      Finally, data integrity is a major concern in most installations.
      Modifications to data files can have consequences ranging from minor to
      disastrous.
    </p>
    <h5 id="communication-lines-and-networks">
      Communication lines and networks
    </h5>
    <p>Networks security attacks can be classified as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Passive attacks: they are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or
        monitoring of, transmissions. The goal of the attacker is to obtain
        information that is being transmitted. Passive attacks are very
        difficult to detect because they do not involve any alteration of the
        data. Typically, the message traffic is sent and received in an
        apparently normal fashion and neither the sender nor receiver is aware
        that a third party has read the messages or observer the traffic
        pattern. So, two types of passive attacks are:
        <ul>
          <li>the release of message contents;</li>
          <li>traffic analysis.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Active attacks: they involve some modification of the data stream or the
        creation of a false stream and can be subdivided into four categories:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Replay: it involves the passive capture of a data unit and its
            subsequent retransmission to produce an unauthorized effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Masquerade: it takes place when one entity pretends to be a
            different entity. A masquerade attack usually includes one of the
            other forms of active attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modification of messages: it simply means that some portion of a
            legitimate message is altered, or that messages are delayed or
            reordered, to produce an unauthorized effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Denial of service: it prevents or inhibits the normal use or
            management of communication facilities.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="14-fundamental-security-design-principles">
      1.4 Fundamental Security Design Principles
    </h3>
    <p>Fundamental security design principles are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Economy of mechanism: it means the design of security measures embodied
        in both hardware and software should be as simple and small as possible.
        The motivation for this principle is that relatively simple, small
        design is easier to test and verify thoroughly. Furthermore, because
        configuration management issues are simplified, updating or replacing a
        simple mechanism becomes a less intensive process. In practice, this is
        perhaps the most difficult principle to honor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fail-safe default: it means access decisions should be based on
        permission rather than exclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete mediation: it means every access must be checked against the
        access control mechanism. Systems should not rely on access decisions
        retrieved from a cache.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open design: it means the design of a security mechanism should be open
        rather than secret. For example, although encryption keys must be
        secret, encryption algorithms should be open to public scrutiny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Least privilege: it means every process and every user of the system
        should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to perform
        the task. The system security policy can identify and define the various
        roles of users or processes. Each role is assigned only those
        permissions needed to perform its functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Least common mechanism: it means the design should minimize the
        functions shared by different users, providing mutual security.
      </li>
      <li>
        Psychological acceptability: it implies the security mechanisms should
        not interfere unduly with the work of users, and at the same time meet
        the needs of those who authorize access. If security mechanisms hinder
        the usability or accessibility of resources, users may opt to turn off
        those mechanisms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Isolation: it's a principle that applies in three contexts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, public access systems should be isolated from critical
            resources (data, processes, etc.) to prevent disclosure or
            tampering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Second, the processes and files of individual users should be
            isolated from one another except where it is explicitly desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, security mechanisms should be isolated in the sense of
            preventing access to those mechanisms.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Encapsulation: it can be viewed as a specific form of isolation based on
        object-oriented functionality. Protection is provided by encapsulating a
        collection of procedures and data objects in a domain of its own so that
        the internal structure of a data object is accessible only to the
        procedures of the protected subsystem and the procedures may be called
        only at designated domain entry points.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modularity: in the context of security it refers both to the development
        of security functions as separate, protected modules, and to the use of
        a modular architecture for mechanism design and implementation. With
        respect to the use of separate security modules, the design goal here is
        to provide common security functions and services, such as cryptographic
        functions, as common modules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layering: it refers to the use of multiple, overlapping protection
        approaches addressing the people, technology, and operational aspects of
        information systems. By using multiple, overlapping protection
        approaches, the failure or circumvention of any individual protection
        approach will no leave the system unprotected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Least astonishment: it means a program or user interface should always
        respond in the way that is least likely to astonish the user.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="15-attack-surfaces-and-attack-trees">
      1.5 Attack Surfaces and Attack Trees
    </h3>
    <h4 id="attack-surfaces">Attack Surfaces</h4>
    <p>
      An attack surface consists of the reachable and exploitable
      vulnerabilities in a system. Attack surfaces can be categorized in the
      following way:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Network attack surface: this category refers to vulnerabilities over an
        enterprise network, wide-area network, or the Internet. Included in this
        category are network protocol vulnerabilities, such as those user for
        DoS attack, disruption of communications links, and various forms of
        intruder attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Software attack surface: this refers to vulnerabilities in application,
        utility, or OS code. A particular focus in this category is Web server
        software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Human attack surface: this category refers to vulnerabilities created by
        personnel or outsiders, such as social engineering, human error, and
        trusted insiders.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An attack surface analysis is a useful technique for assessing the scale
      and severity of threats to a system. A systematic analysis of points of
      vulnerability makes developers and security analysts aware of where
      security mechanisms are required. Once an attack surface is defined,
      designers may be able to find ways to make the surface smaller, thus
      making the task of the adversary more difficult. The use of layering, or
      defense in depth, and attack surface reduction complement each other in
      mitigating security risk.
    </p>
    <h4 id="attack-trees">Attack Trees</h4>
    <p>
      An attack tree is a branching, hierarchical data structure that represents
      a set of potential techniques for exploiting security vulnerabilities. The
      security incident that is the goal of the attack is represented as the
      root node of the tree, and the ways by which an attacker could reach that
      goal are iteratively and incrementally represented as branches and
      subnodes of the tree. Each subnode defines a subgoal, and each subgoal may
      have its own set of further subgoals, and so on. The final nodes on the
      paths outward from the root, that is, the leaf nodes, represent different
      ways to initiate an attack. Each node other than a leaf is either an
      AND-node or an OR-node. Branches can be labeled with values representing
      difficulty, cost, or other attack attributes, so that alternative attacks
      can be compared.<br />
      The motivation for the use of attack trees is to effectively exploit the
      information available on attack patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis used to generate this tree considered the three components
      involved in authentication:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        User terminal and user (UT/U): these attacks target the user equipment,
        including the tokens that may be involved, such as smartcards or other
        password generators, as well as the actions of the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communication channel (CC): this type of attack focuses on communication
        links.
      </li>
      <li>
        Internet banking server (IBS): these types of attacks are offline attack
        against the servers that host the Internet banking application.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Five overall attack strategies can be identified, each of which exploits
      one or more of the three components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        User credential compromise: this strategy can be used against many
        elements of the attack surface. There are procedural attacks (such as
        monitoring a user's action to observe credentials), token attack tools
        (brute force or hacking a smartcard), to embed malicious software,
        sniffing, and various means to engage in communications with the target
        user.
      </li>
      <li>
        Injection of commands: in this type of attack, the attacker is able to
        intercept communication between the UT and the IBS.
      </li>
      <li>
        User credential guessing: brute force attacks against banking
        authentication schemes. The attack mechanisms is based on distributed
        zombie personal computers, hosting automated programs for username (or
        password) based calculation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Security policy violation: for example, violating the bank's security
        policy in combination with weak access control and logging mechanisms,
        an employee may cause an internal security incident and expose a
        customer's account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use of known authenticated session: this type of attack persuades or
        forces the user to connect to the IBS with a preset session ID. Once the
        user authenticates to the server, the attacker may utilize the known
        session ID to send packets to the IBS, spoofing the user's identity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="16-computer-security-strategy">1.6 Computer Security Strategy</h3>
    <p>A comprehensive security strategy involves three aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specification/policy: what is the security scheme supposed to do?</li>
      <li>Implementation/mechanisms: how does it do it?</li>
      <li>Correctness/assurance: does it really work?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="security-policy">Security Policy</h4>
    <p>
      The first step in devising security services and mechanisms is to develop
      a security policy. At the least, a security policy is an informal
      description of desired system behaviour. More usefully, a security policy
      is a formal statement of rules and practices that specify or regulate how
      a system or organization provides security services to protect sensitive
      and critical system resources (RFC 4949). Such a formal security policy
      lends itself to being enforced by the system's technical controls as well
      as its management and operational controls.<br />
      In developing a security policy, a security manager needs to consider the
      following factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The value of the assets being protected.</li>
      <li>The vulnerabilities of the system.</li>
      <li>Potential threats and the likelihood of attacks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further, the manager must consider the following trade-offs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ease of use versus security: virtually all security measures involve
        some penalty in the area of ease of use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cost of security versus cost of failure and recovery: in addition to
        ease of use and performance costs, there are direct monetary costs in
        implementing and maintaining security measures. All of these costs must
        be balanced against the cost of security failure and recovery if certain
        security measures are lacking.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Security policy is thus a business decision, possibly influenced by legal
      requirements.
    </p>
    <h4 id="security-implementation">Security Implementation</h4>
    <p>
      Security implementation involves four complementary courses of action:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prevention: an ideal security scheme is one in which no attack is
        successful. Although this is not practical in all cases, there is a wide
        range of threats in which prevention is a reasonable goal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detection: in a number of cases, absolute protection is not feasible,
        but it is practical to detect security attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Response: if security mechanisms detect an ongoing attack, the system
        may be able to respond in such a way as to halt the attack and prevent
        further damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recovery: an example of recovery is the use of backup systems, so if
        data integrity is compromised, a prior, correct copy of the data can be
        reloaded.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="assurance-and-evaluation">Assurance and Evaluation</h4>
    <p>
      Assurance is an attribute of an information system that provides grounds
      for having confidence that the system operates such that the system's
      security policy is enforced. This encompasses both system design and
      system implementation. Assurance is expressed as a degree of confidence,
      not in terms of a formal proof that a design or implementation is correct.
      The state of the art in proving designs and implementations is such that
      it is not possible to provide absolute proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evaluation is the process of examining a computer product or system with
      respect to certain criteria. Evaluation involves testing and may also
      involve formal analytic or mathematical techniques. The central thrust of
      work in this area is the development of evaluation criteria that can be
      applied to any security system and that are broadly supported for making
      product comparisons.

      2.1 Confidentiality with Symmetric Encryption
    </h3>
    <p>
      The universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or
      stored data is symmetric encryption.
    </p>
    <h4 id="symmetric--encryption">Symmetric Encryption</h4>
    <p>
      Symmetric encryption, also referred to as conventional encryption or
      single-key encryption, was the only type of encryption in use prior to the
      introduction of public-key encryption in the late 1970s.
    </p>
    <p>A symmetric encryption scheme has five ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Plaintext: this is the original message or data that is fed into the
        algorithm as input.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encryption algorithm: the encryption algorithm performs various
        substitutions and transformations on the plaintext.
      </li>
      <li>
        Secret key: the secret key is also input to the encryption algorithm.
        The exact substitutions and transformations performed by the algorithm
        depend on the key.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ciphertext: this is the scrambled message produced as output. It depends
        on the plaintext and the secret key.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decryption algorithm: this is essentially the encryption algorithm run
        in reverse. it takes the ciphertext and the secret key and produces the
        original plaintext.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are two requirements for secure use of symmetric encryption:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The opponent should be unable to decrypt ciphertext or discover the key
        even if he or she is in possession of a number of ciphertexts together
        with the plaintext that produced each ciphertext.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a
        secure fashion and must keep the key secure.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are two general approaches to attacking a symmetric encryption
      scheme.<br />
      The first attack is known as <em>cryptanalysis</em>. Cryptanalytic attacks
      rely on the nature of the algorithm plus perhaps some knowledge of the
      general characteristics of the plaintext, or even some sample
      plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This type of attack exploits the
      characteristics of the algorithm to attempt to deduce a specific plaintext
      or to deduce the key being used.<br />
      The second method, known as the <em>brute-force attack</em>, it to try
      every possible key on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible
      translation into plaintext is obtained.

      Symmetric Block Encryption Algorithms
    </h4>
    <p>
      The most commonly used symmetric encryption algorithms are block ciphers.
      A block cipher processes the plaintext input in fixed-size blocks and
      produces a block of ciphertext of equal size for each plaintext block. The
      algorithm processes longer plaintext amounts as a series of fixed-size
      blocks. The most important symmetric algorithms, all of which are block
      ciphers, are the <em>Data Encryption Standard</em> (DES), triple DES, and
      the <em>Advanced Encryption Standard</em> (AES).

      Until recently, the most widely used encryption scheme was based on the
      DES adopted in 1977 by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) as FIPS
      PUB 46.<br />
      DES takes a plaintext block of 64 bits and a key of 56 bits, to produce a
      ciphertext block of 64 bits.<br />
      Concerns about the strength of DES fall into two categories: concerns
      about the algorithm itself, and concerns about the use of a 56-bit key.<br />
      The first concern refers to the possibility that cryptanalysis is possible
      by exploiting the characteristics of the DES algorithm. Despite numerous
      approaches, no one has so far reported a fatal weakness in DES.<br />
      A more serious concern is key length. With a key length of 56 bits, there
      are

      >) key combinations per second is reasonable for today's multicore
      computers.<br />
      With this results in mind, a single PC can break DES in about a year; if
      multiple PCs work in parallel, the time is drastically shortened. And
      today's supercomputers should be able to find a key in about an hour. Key
      sizes of 128 bits or greater are effectively unbreakable using simply
      brute-force approach.
    </p>
    <h5 id="triple-des">Triple DES</h5>
    <p>
      The life of DES was extended by the use of triple DES (3DES), which
      involves repeating the basic DES three times, using either two or three
      unique keys, for a key size of 112 or 168 bits. 3DES was first
      standardized for use in financial applications in ANSI standard X9.17 in
      1985. 3DES was incorporated as part of the DES in 1999, with the
      publication of FIPS PUB 46-3.<br />
      3DES has two attractions that assure its widespread use over the next few
      years. First, with its 168-bit key length, it overcomes the vulnerability
      to brute-force attack of DES. Second, the underlying encryption algorithm
      in 3DES is the same as in DES. This algorithm has been subjected to more
      scrutiny than any other encryption algorithm over a longer period of time,
      and no effective cryptanalytic attack based on the algorithm rather than
      brute force has been found. Accordingly, there is a high level of
      confidence that 3DES is very resistant to cryptanalysis.<br />
      The principal drawback of 3DES is that the algorithm is relatively
      sluggish in software. A secondary drawback is that both DES and 3DES use a
      64-bit block size. For reasons of both efficiency and security, a larger
      block size is desirable.

      Typically, symmetric encryption is applied to a unit of data larger than a
      single 64-bit or 128-bit block. Plaintext sources must be broken up into a
      series of fixed-length block for encryption by a symmetric block cipher.
      The simplest approach to multiple-block encryption is knows as electronic
      codebook (ECB) mode, in which plaintext is handled <em>b</em> bit at a
      time and each block of plaintext is encrypted using the same key.

      For lengthy messages, the ECB mode may not be secure. A cryptanalyst may
      be able to exploit regularities in the plaintext to ease the task of
      decryption.<br />
      To increse the security of symmetric block encryption for large sequences
      of data, a number of alternative techniques have been developed, called
      <em>modes of operation</em>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="stream-ciphers">Stream Ciphers</h4>
    <p>
      A block cipher processes the input one block of elements at a time,
      producing an output block for each input block. A
      <em>stream cipher</em> processes the input elements continuously,
      producing output one element at a time, as it goeas along. Although block
      ciphers are far more common, there are certain applications in which a
      stream cipher is more appropriate.<br />
      A typical stream cipher encrypts plaintext one byte at a time, although a
      stream cipher may be designed to operate on one bit at a time or on units
      larger than a byte at a <a href="http://time.In">time.In</a> the structure
      of stream cipher, a key is input to a pseudorandom bit generator that
      produces a stream of 8-bit numbers that are apparently random (a
      pseudorandom stream is one that is unpredictable without knowledge of the
      input key and which has an apparently random character). The output of the
      generator, called a keystream, is combined one byte at a time with the
      plaintext stream using the bitwise XOR operation.<br />
      With a properly designed pseudorandom number generator, a stream cipher
      can be as secure as a block cipher of comparable key length. The primary
      advantage of a stream cipher is that stream cipher are almost always
      faster and use far less code than do block ciphers. The advantage of a
      block cipher is that you can reuse keys.

    <h3 id="22-message-authentication-and-hash-functions">
      2.2 Message Authentication and Hash Functions
    </h3>
    <p>
      Encryption protects against passive attack (eavesdropping). A different
      requirement is to protect against active attack (falsification of data and
      transactions). Protection against such attacks is known as message or data
      authentication.<br />
      Message or data authentication is a procedure that allows communicating
      parties to verify that received or stored messages are authentic. The two
      important aspects are to verify that the contents of the message have not
      been altered and that the source is authentic.
    </p>
    <h4 id="authentication-using-symmetric-encryption">
      Authentication Using Symmetric Encryption
    </h4>
    <p>
      It would seem possible to perform authentication simply by the use of
      symmetric encryption. In fact, symmetric encryption alone is not a
      suitable tool for data authentication.<br />
      To give one simple example, in the ECB mode of encryption, if an attacker
      reorders the blocks of ciphertext, then each block will still decrypt
      successfully. However, the reordering may alter the meaning of the overall
      data sequence. Thus, block reordering is a threat.
    </p>
    <h4 id="message-authentication-without-message-encryption">
      Message Authentication without Message Encryption
    </h4>
    <p>
      An authentication tag is generated and appended to each message for
      transmission. The message itself is not encrypted and can be read at the
      destination independent of the authentication function at the destination.
      Because this approach do not encrypt the message, message confidentiality
      is not provided.<br />
      Message encryption by itself does not provide a secure form of
      authentication. However, it is possible to combine authentication and
      confidentiality in a single algorithm by encrypting a message plus its
      authentication tag. Typically, however, message authentication is provided
      as a separate function from message encryption. A paper suggests three
      situations in which message authentication without confidentiality is
      preferable:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        There are a number of applications in which the same message is
        broadcast to a number of destinations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another possible scenario is an exchange in which one side has a heavy
        load and cannot afford the time to decrypt all incoming messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Authentication of a computer program in plaintext is an attractive
        service. The computer program can be executed without having to decrypt
        it every time, which would be wasteful of processor resources. However,
        if a message authentication tag were attached to the program, it could
        be checked whenever assurance is required of the integrity of the
        program.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Thus, there is a place for both authentication and encryption in meeting
      security requirements.
    </p>
    <h5 id="message-authentication-code">Message Authentication Code</h5>
    <p>
      One authentication technique involves the use of a secret key to generate
      a small block of data, known as a message authentication code, that is
      appended to the message. This technique assumes that two communicating
      parties, say A and B, share a common secret key

      >. The message plus code are transmitted to the intended recipient. The
      recipient performs the same calculation on the received message, using the
      same secret key, to generate a new message authentication code. The
      received code is compared to the calculated code. If we assume that only
      the receiver and the sender know the identity of the secret key, and if
      the received code matches the calculated code, then:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The receiver is assured that the message has not been altered.</li>
      <li>The receiver is assured that the message is from alleged sender.</li>
      <li>
        If the message includes a sequence number then the receiver can be
        assured of the proper sequence.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A number of algorithms could be used to generate the code. AES would now
      be the most suitable choice. DES or AES is used to generate an encrypted
      version of the message, and some of the bits of ciphertext are used as the
      code. A 16 or 32 bit code used to be typical, but would now be much too
      small to provide sufficient collision resistance.<br />
      The process just described is similar to encryption. One difference is
      that the authentication algorithm need not be reversible, as it must for
      decryption. It turns out that because of the mathematical properties of
      the authentication function, it is less vulnerable to being broken than
      encryption.

    <h5 id="one-way-hash-function">One-Way Hash Function</h5>
    <p>
      An alternative to the message authentication code is the one-way hash
      function. As with the message authentication code, a hash function accepts
      a variable-size message <em>M</em> as input and produces a fixed-size
      message digest

      as output. Typically, the message is padded out to an integer multiple of
      some fixed length (e.g., 1024 bits) and the padding includes the value of
      the length of the original message in bits.<br />
      Unlike the MAC, a hash function does not take a secret key as input. The
      message digest can be encrypted using symmetric encryption; if it is
      assumed that only the sender and receiver share the encryption key, then
      authenticity is assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message digest can also be encrypted using public-key encryption. The
      public-key approach has two advantages: it provides a digital signature as
      well as message authentication, and it does not require the distribution
      of keys to communicating parties.<br />
      These two approaches have an advantage over approaches that encrypt the
      entire message, in that less computation is required. But an even more
      common approach is the use of a technique that avoids encryption
      altogether. Several reasons for this interest are in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption software is quite slow.</li>
      <li>Encryption hardware costs are non-negligible.</li>
      <li>Encryption hardware is optimized toward large data sizes.</li>
      <li>An encryption algorithm may be protected by a patent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The technique that uses a hash function but no encryption for message
      authentication, known as a keyed hash MAC, assumes that two communicating
      parties, say A and B, share a common secret key <em>K</em>. This secret
      key is incorporated into the process of generating a hash code. When A has
      a message to send to B, it calculates the hash function over the
      concatenation of the secret key and the message:

      >. Because the secret key itself is not sent, it should not be possible
      for an attacker to modify an intercepted message. As long as the secret
      key remains secret, it should not be possible for an attacker to generate
      a false message.<br />
      Note the secret key is used as both a prefix and a suffix to the message.
      If the secret key is used as either only a prefix or only a suffix, the

    <h4 id="secure-hash-functions">Secure Hash Functions</h4>
    <p>
      The one-was hash function, or secure hash function, is important not only
      in message authentication but also in digital signatures.
    </p>
    <h4 id="hash-function-requirements">Hash Function Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of a hash function is to produce a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of
      a file, message, or other block of data. To be useful for message
      authentication, a hash function H must have the following properties:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>H can be applied to a block of data of any size.</li>
      <li>H produces a fixed-length output.</li>
      <li>
        H(x) is relatively easy to compute for any given <em>x</em>, making both
        hardware and software implementations practical.
      </li>
      <li>
        For any given code <em>h</em>, it is computationally infeasible to find
        x such that

    <p>
      The fourth property is the one-way property: it is easy to generate a code
      given a message, but virtually impossible to generate a message given a
      code. This property is important if the authentication technique involves
      the use of a secret value.<br />
      The fifth property guarantees that it is impossible to find an alternative
      message with the same hash value as a given message. This prevents forgery
      when an encrypted hash code is used.<br />
      A hash function that satisfies the first five properties is referred to as
      a weak hash function. If the sixth property is also satisfied, then it is
      referred to as a strong hash function. A strong hash function protects
      against an attack in which one party generates a message for another party
      to sign.<br />
      In addition to providing authentication, a message digest also provides
      data integrity. It performs the same function as a frame check sequence:
      if any bits in the message are accidentally altered in transit, the
      message digest will be in error.

    <h5 id="security-of-hash-functions">Security of Hash Functions</h5>
    <p>
      As with symmetric encryption, there are two approaches to attacking a
      secure hash function: cryptanalysis and brute-force attack.<br />
      As with symmetric encryption algorithms, cryptanalysis of a hash function
      involves exploiting logical weaknesses in the algorithm.<br />
      The strength of a hash function against brute-force attacks depends solely
      on the length of the hash code produced by the algorithm. For a hash code
      of length <em>n</em>, the level of effort required is proportional to the
      following:

      Secure Hash Function ALgorithms
    </h5>
    <p>
      In recent years, the most widely used hash functions has been the Secure
      Hash Algorithm (SHA). SHA was developed by the NIST and published (FIPS
      180) in 1993. When weakness were discovered in SHA, a revised version was
      issued as FIPS 180-1 in 1995 and is generally referred to as SHA-1. SHA-1
      produces a hash value of 160 bits. In 2002, NIST produced a revised
      version of the standard, FIPS 180-2, that defined three new versions of
      SHA, with hash value lengths of 256, 384, and 512 bits, known as SHA-256,
      SHA-384 and SHA-512. These new versions, collectively know as SHA-2, are
      teh same as SHA-1.<br />
      SHA-2, particularly the 512-bit version, would appear to provide
      unassailable security. However, because of the structural similarity of
      SHA-2 to SHA-1, NIST decided to standardize a new hash function that is
      very different from SHA-2 and SHA-1. This new hash function, known as
      SHA-3, was published in 2015 and is now available as an alternative to
      SHA-2.

    <h3 id="23-public-key-encryption">2.3 Public-Key Encryption</h3>
    <p>
      Of equal importance to symmetric encryption is public-key encryption,
      which finds use in message authentication and key distribution.
    </p>
    <h4 id="public-key-encryption-structure">
      Public-Key Encryption Structure
    </h4>
    <p>
      Public-key encryption was first publicised by Diffie and Hellman in
      1976.<br />
      Public-key algorithms are based on mathematica functions rather than on
      simple operations on bit patterns. More important, public-key cryptography
      is <em>asymmetric</em>, involving the use of two separate keys. The use of
      two keys ha profound consequences in the areas of confidentiality, key
      distribution, and authentication.<br />
      There is nothing in principle about either symmetric or public-key
      encryption that makes one superior to another from the point of view of
      resisting cryptanalysis. Because of the computational overhead of current
      public-key encryption schemes, there seems no foreseeable likelihood that
      symmetric encryption will be abandoned.<br />
      For public-key key distribution, some form of protocol is needed, often
      involving a central agent, and the procedures involved are no simpler or
      any more efficient thant those required for symmetric encryption.
    </p>
    <p>A public-key encryption scheme has six ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plaintext.</li>
      <li>Encryption algorithm.</li>
      <li>
        Public and private key: this is a pair of keys that have been selected
        so if one is used for encryption, the other is user for decryption. The
        exact transformations performed by the encryption algorithm depend on
        the public or private key that is provided as input.
      </li>
      <li>Ciphertext.</li>
      <li>Decryption algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The public key of the pair is made public for others to use, while private
      key is known only to its owner. A general purpose public-key cryptographic
      algorithm relies on one key for encryption and a different but related key
      for decryption.<br />
      The essential steps are the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Each user generates a pair of keys to be used for the encryption and
        decryption of messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each user places one of the two keys in a public register or other
        accessible file. This is the public key. The companion key is kept
        private.
      </li>
      <li>
        If Bob wishes to send a private message to Alice, Bob encrypt the
        message using Alice's public key.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Alice receives the message, she decrypts it using her private key.
        No other recipient can decrypt the message because only Alice knows
        Alice's private key.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      With this approach, all participants have access to public keys, and
      private keys are generated locally by each participant and therefore need
      never be distributed. As long as a user protects his or her private key,
      incoming communication is secure. This schema is directed toward providing
      confidentiality. Only the intended recipient should be able to decrypt the
      ciphertext because only the intended recipient is in possession of the
      required private key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mode of operation of public-key cryptography is: a user encrypts
      data using his or her own private key. Anyone who knows the corresponding
      public key will then be able to decrypt the message. This scheme is
      directed toward providing authentication and/or data integrity. If a user
      is able to successfully recover the plaintext from Bob's ciphertext using
      Bob's public key, this indicates only Bob could have encrypted the
      plaintext, thus providing authentication.

      Applications for Public-Key Cryptosystems
    </h4>
    <p>
      In broad terms, we can classify the use of public-key cryptosystems into
      three categories: digital signature, symmetric key distribution, and
      encryption of secret keys. Some algorithms are suitable for all three
      applications, whereas others can be used only for one or two of these
      application. Following table indicates the applications supported by the
      algorithms that will be discussed.

    <h5 id="digital-signature-standard">Digital Signature Standard</h5>

      The DSS makes use of SHA-1 and presents a new digital signature technique,
      the Digital Signature ALgorithm (DSA). The Digital Signature Standard
      (DSS) was originally proposed in 1991 and revised in 1993 in response to
      public feedback concerning the security of the scheme. There were further
      revisions in 1998, 2000, 2009, and most recently in 2013. The DSS uses an
      algorithm that is designed to provide only the digital signature function.
      Unlike RSA, it cannot be used for encryption or key exchange.

    <h5 id="elliptic-curve-cryptography">Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h5>
    <p>
      Recently, a competing system has begun to challenge RSA: elliptic curve
      cryptography (ECC). The principal attraction of ECC compared to RSA is
      that it appears to offer equal security for a far smaller bit size,
      thereby reducing processing overhead. On the other hand, although the
      theory of ECC has been around for some time, it is only recently that
      products have begun to appear and that there has been sustained
      cryptanalytic interest in probing for weaknesses. Thus, the confidence
      level in ECC is not yet as high as that in RSA.
    </p>
    <h3 id="24-digital-signatures-and-key-management">
      2.4 Digital Signatures and Key Management
    </h3>
    <p>
      With respect to key management and distribution, there are at least three
      distinct aspects to the use of public-key encryption in this regard:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The secure distribution of public keys.</li>
      <li>The use of public-key encryption to distribute secret keys.</li>
      <li>
        The use of public-key encryption to create temporary keys for message
        encryption.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="digital-signature">Digital Signature</h4>
    <p>
      Public-key encryption can be used for authentication with a technique
      known as the digital signature. NIST FIPS PUB 186-4 defines a digital
      signature as follows: the result of a cryptographic transformation of data
      that, when properly implemented, provides a mechanism for verifying origin
      authentication, data integrity and signatory non-repudiation.<br />
      Thus, a digital signature is a data-dependent bit pattern, generated by an
      agent as a function of a file, message, or other form of data block.
      Another agent can access the data block and its associated signature and
      verify:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the data block has been signed by the alleged signer;</li>
      <li>the data block has not been altered since the signing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      FIPS 186-4 specifies the use of one of three digital signature algorithms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA): the original NIST-approved algorithm,
        which is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms.
      </li>
      <li>
        RSA Digital Signature Algorithm: based on the RSA public-key algorithm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA): based on
        elliptic-curve cryptography.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The digital signature does not provide confidentiality. That is, the
      message being sent is safe from alteration, but not safe from
      eavesdropping. This is obvious in the case of a signature based on a
      portion of the message, because the rest of the message is transmitted in
      the clear. Even in the case of complete encryption, there is no protection
      of confidentiality because any observer can decrypt the message by using
      the sender's public key.
    </p>
    <h4 id="public-key-certificates">Public-Key Certificates</h4>
    <p>
      On the face of it, the point of public-key encryption is that the public
      key is public. Thus, if there is some broadly accepted public-key
      algorithm, such as RSA, any participant can send his or her public key to
      any other participant or broadcast the key to the community at large.
      Although this approach is convenient, it has a major weakness. Anyone can
      forge such a public announcement. That is, some user could pretend to be
      Bob and send a public key to another participant or broadcast such a
      public key. Until such time as Bob discovers the forgery and alerts other
      participants, the forger is able to read all encrypted messages intended
      for Bob and can use the forged keys for authentication.<br />
      The solution to this problem is the public-key certificate. In essence, a
      certificate consists of a public key plus a user ID of the key owner, with
      the whole block signed by a trusted third party. The certificate also
      includes some information about the third party plus an indication of the
      period of validity of the certificate. Typically, the third party is a
      certificate authority (CA) that is trusted by the user community, such as
      a government agency or a financial institution. A user can present his or
      her public key to the authority in a secure manner and obtain a signed
      certificate. The user can then publish the certificate. Anyone needing
      this user's public key can obtain the certificate and verify that it is
      valid by means of the attached trusted signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      One scheme has become universally accepted for formatting public-key
      certificates: the X.509 standard. It is used in IPsec, TLS, SSH, S/MIME
      and others.
    </p>
    <h4 id="symmetric-key-exchange-using-public-key-encryption">
      Symmetric Key Exchange Using Public-Key Encryption
    </h4>
    <p>
      With symmetric encryption, a fundamental requirement for two parties to
      communicate securely is that they share a secret key. Suppose Bob wants to
      create a messaging application that will enable him to exchange e-mail
      securely with anyone who has access to the Internet. Suppose Bob wants to
      do this using symmetric encryption. With symmetric encryption, Bob and his
      correspondent, say, Alice, must come up with a way to share a unique
      secret key that no one else knows. How are they going to do that?<br />
      One approach is the use of Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This approach is
      indeed widely used. However, it suffers the drawback that, in its simplest
      form, Diffie-Hellman provides no authentication of the two communicating
      partners. There are variations to Diffie-Hellman that overcome this
      problem. In addition, there are protocols using other public-key
      algorithms that achieve the same objective.
    </p>
    <h4 id="digital-envelopes">Digital Envelopes</h4>
    <p>
      Another application in which public-key encryption is used to protect a
      symmetric key is the digital envelope, which can be used to protect a
      message without needing to first arrange for sender and receiver to have
      the same secret key. The technique is referred to as a digital envelope,
      which is the equivalent of a sealed envelope containing an unsigned
      letter.<br />
      Suppose Bob wishes to send a confidential message to Alice, but they do
      not share a symmetric secret key. Bob does the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare a message.</li>
      <li>
        Generate a random symmetric key that will be used this one time only.
      </li>
      <li>Encrypt that message using symmetric encryption the one-time key.</li>
      <li>
        Encrypt the one-time key using public-key encryption with Alice's public
        key.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attach the encrypted one-time key to the encrypted message and sent it
        to Alice.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Only Alice is capable of decrypting the one-time key and therefore of
      recovering the original message. If Bob obtained Alice's public key by
      means of Alice's public-key certificate, then Bob is assured that it is a
      valid key.

      2.5 Random and Pseudorandom Numbers
    </h3>
    <p>
      Random numbers play an important role in the use of encryption for various
      network security applications.
    </p>
    <h4 id="the-use-of-random-numbers">The Use of Random Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      A number of network security algorithms based on cryptography make use of
      random numbers. These applications give rise to two distinct and not
      necessarily compatible requirements for a sequence of random numbers:
      randomness and unpredictability.
    </p>
    <h5 id="randomness">Randomness</h5>
    <p>
      Traditionally, the concern in the generation of a sequence of allegedly
      random numbers has been that the sequence of numbers be random in some
      well-defined statistical sense. The following two criteria are used to
      validate that a sequence of numbers is random:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Uniform distribution: the distribution of numbers in the sequence should
        be uniform.
      </li>
      <li>
        Independence: none one value in the sequence can be inferred from the
        others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although there are well-defined tests for determining that a sequence of
      numbers matches a particular distribution, there is no such test to
      &quot;prove&quot; independence. Rather, a number of tests can be applied
      to demonstrate if a sequence does not exhibit independence. The general
      strategy is to apply a number of such tests until the confidence that
      independence exists is sufficiently strong.<br />
      The use of a sequence of numbers that appear statistically random often
      occurs in the design of algorithms related to cryptography.<br />
      In essence, if a problem is too hard or time-consuming to solve exactly, a
      simpler, shorter approach based on randomization is used to provide an
      answer with any desired level of confidence.
    </p>
    <h5 id="unpredictability">Unpredictability</h5>
    <p>
      In applications such as reciprocal authentication and sessions key
      generation, the requirement is not so much that the sequence of numbers be
      statistically random, but that the successive members of the sequence are
      unpredictable. With &quot;true&quot; random sequences, each number is
      statistically independent of other numbers in the sequence and therefore
      unpredictable. However, true random numbers are not always used; rather,
      sequences of numbers that appear to be random are generated by some
      algorithm. In this latter case, care must be taken that an opponent is not
      able to predict future elements of the sequence on the basis of earlier
      elements.

    <h4 id="random-versus-pseudorandom">Random versus Pseudorandom</h4>
    <p>
      Cryptographic applications typically make use of algorithmic techniques
      for random number generation. These algorithms are deterministic and
      therefore produce sequences of numbers that are not statistically random.
      However, if the algorithm is good, the resulting sequences will pass many
      reasonable tests of randomness. Such numbers are referred to as
      pseudorandom numbers.<br />
      Under most circumstances, pseudorandom numbers will perform as well as if
      they were random for a given use. The phrase &quot;as well as&quot; is
      unfortunately subjective, but the use of pseudorandom numbers is widely
      accepted. A true random number generator (TRNG) uses a nondeterministic
      source to produce randomness.

      User authentication is the basis for most types of access control and for
      user accountability. User authentication encompasses two functions. First,
      the user identifies herself to the system by presenting a credential.
      Second, the system verifies the user by the exchange of authentication
      information.

    <h3 id="31-digital-user-authentication-principles">
      3.1 Digital User Authentication Principles
    </h3>
    <p>
      NIST SP 800-63-3 defines digital user authentication as the process of
      establishing confidence in user identifies that are presented
      electronically to an information system. Systems can use the authenticated
      identity to determine if the authenticated individual is authorized to
      perform particular functions. In many cases, the authentication and
      transaction, or other authorized function, take place across an open
      network such as the Internet.
    </p>
    <h4 id="means-of-authentication">Means of Authentication</h4>
    <p>
      There are four general means of authenticating a user's identity, which
      can be used alone or in combination:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Something the individual knows.</li>
      <li>
        Something the individual possess: this type of authenticator is referred
        to as a token.
      </li>
      <li>Something the individual is (static biometrics).</li>
      <li>
        Something the individual does (dynamic biometrics): recognition by voice
        pattern, handwriting, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these methods, properly implemented and used, can provide secure
      user authentication. However, each method has problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multifactor authentication refers to the use of more than one of the
      authentications means in the preceding list. The strength of
      authentication systems is largely determined by the number of factors
      incorporated by the system.

      3.2 Password-Based Authentication
    </h3>
    <p>
      A widely used line of defense against intruders is the password system.
    </p>
    <h4 id="the-vulnerability-of-passwords">The Vulnerability of Passwords</h4>
    <p>
      Typically, a system that uses password-based authentication maintains a
      password file indexed by user ID. One technique that is typically used is
      to store not the user's password but a one-was hash function of the
      password. We can identify the following attack strategies and
      countermeasures:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Offline dictionary attack: the attacker obtains the system password file
        and compares the password hashes against hashes of commonly used
        password. If a match is found, the attacker can gain access by that
        ID/password combination. Countermeasures include controls to prevent
        unauthorized access to the password file, intrusion detection measures
        to identify a compromise, and rapid reissuance of passwords should the
        password file be compromised.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specific account attack: the attacker targets a specific account and
        submits password guesses until the correct password is discovered. The
        standard countermeasure is an account lockout mechanism.
      </li>
      <li>
        Popular password attack: a variation of the preceding attack is to use a
        popular password and try it against a wide range of user IDs.
        Countermeasures include policies to inhibit the selection by users of
        common passwords and scanning the IP addresses of authentication
        requests and client cookies for submission patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Password guessing against single user: the attacker attempts to gain
        knowledge about the account holder and system password policies and uses
        that knowledge to guess the password. Countermeasures include training
        in and enforcement of password policies that make passwords difficult to
        guess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Workstation hijacking: the attacker waits until a logged-in workstation
        is unattended. The standard countermeasure is automatically logging the
        workstation out after a period of inactivity. Intrusion detection
        schemes can be used to detect changes in user behaviour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exploiting user mistakes: if the system assigns a password, then the
        user is more likely to write it down because it is difficult to
        remember. This situation creates the potential for an adversary to read
        the written password. Unless these preconfigured passwords are changed,
        they are easily guessed. Countermeasures include user training,
        intrusion detection, and simpler passwords combined with another
        authentication mechanism.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exploiting multiple password use: attacks can also become much more
        effective or damaging if different network devices share the same or a
        similar password for a given user. Countermeasures include a policy that
        forbids the same or similar password on particular network devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Electronic monitoring: if a password is communicated across a network to
        log on to a remote system, it is vulnerable to eavesdropping. Simple
        encryption will not fix this problem, because the encrypted password is,
        in effect, the password and can be observer and reused by an adversary.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Despite the many security vulnerabilities of passwords, they remain the
      most commonly used user authentication technique. Among the reasons for
      the persistent popularity of passwords are the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Techniques that utilize client-side hardware require the implementation
        of the appropriate user authentication software to exploit this hardware
        on both the client and server systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Physical tokens are expensive and/or inconvenient to carry around.
      </li>
      <li>
        Schemes that rely on a single sign-on to multiple services create a
        single point of security risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automated password managers that relieve users of the burden of knowing
        and entering passwords have poor support for roaming and synchronization
        across multiple client platforms, and their usability had not be
        adequately researched.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="the-use-of-hashed-passwords">The use of Hashed Passwords</h4>
    <p>
      A widely used password security technique is the use of hashed passwords
      and a salt value. To load a new password into the system, the user selects
      or is assigned a password. This password is combined with a fixed-length
      salt value.<br />
      The password and salt serve as inputs to a hashing algorithm to produce a
      fixed-length hash code. The hash algorithm is designed to be slow to
      execute in order to thwart attacks. The hashed password is then stored,
      together with a plaintext copy of the salt, in the password file for the
      corresponding user ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a user attempts to log on to a UNIX system, the user provides an ID
      and a password. The operating system uses the ID to index into the
      password file and retrieve the plaintext salt and the encrypted password.
      The salt and user-supplied password are used as input to the encryption
      routine. If the result matches the stored value, the password is
      accepted.<br />
      The salt serves three purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It prevents duplicate passwords from being visible in the password file.
      </li>
      <li>
        It greatly increases the difficulty of offline dictionary attacks. For a

    <h5 id="unix-implementations">UNIX Implementations</h5>
    <p>
      The recommended hash function for many UNIX systems, including Linux,
      Solaris and FreeBSD, is based on the MD5 secure hash algorithm. The MD5
      crypt routine uses a salt of up to 48 bits and effectively has no
      limitations on password length. It produces a 128-bit hash value. It is
      also far slower than crypt(3) (the hash routine based on DES). To achieve
      the slowdown, MD5 crypt uses an inner loop with 1000 iterations.<br />
      Probably the most secure version of the UNIX hash/salt scheme was
      developed for OpenBSD, another widely used open source UNIX. This scheme
      uses a hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher. The
      hash function, called Bcrypt, is quite slow to execute. Bcrypt allows
      password of up to 55 characters in length and requires a random salt value
      of 128 bits, to produce a 192-bit hash value. Bcrypt also includes a cost
      variable; an increase in the cost variable causes a corresponding increase
      in the time required to perform a Bcrypt hash. The cost assigned to a new
      password is configurable, so administrators can assign a higher cost to
      privileged users.

    <h4 id="password-cracking-of-user-chosen-passwords">
      Password Cracking of User-Chosen Passwords
    </h4>
    <h5 id="traditional-approaches">Traditional Approaches</h5>
    <p>
      The traditional approach to password guessing is to develop a large
      dictionary of possible passwords and to try each of these against the
      password file. This means that each password must be hashed using each
      available salt value then compared with stored hash values. If no match is
      found, the cracking program tries variations on all the words in its
      dictionary of likely passwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative is to trade off space for time by precomputing potential
      hash values. For each password, the attacker generates the has values
      associated with each possible salt value. The result is a mammoth table of
      hash values known as a rainbow table. This approach can be countered using
      a sufficiently large salt value and a sufficiently large hash length.
    </p>
    <p>
      A particular problem is that users, when permitted to choose their own
      password, tend to choose short ones. The analysis of the 70 million
      passwords estimates that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security
      against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security
      against an optimal offline dictionary attack. It can be seen then that
      using offline search enables an adversary to break a large number of
      accounts, even if a significant amount of iterated hashing is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Password length is only part of the problem. Many people, when permitted
      to choose their own password, pick a password that is guessable. This
      makes the job of password cracking straightforward. The cracker simply has
      to test the password file against lists of likely passwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attacks that use a combination of brute-force and dictionary techniques
      have become common. A notable example of this dual approach is John the
      Ripper, an open-source password cracker first developed in 1996 and still
      in use.
    </p>
    <h5 id="modern-approaches">Modern Approaches</h5>
    <p>
      Sadly, this type of vulnerability has not lessened in the past. However,
      password-cracking techniques have improved to keep pace. The improvements
      are of two kinds.<br />
      First, the processing capacity available for password cracking as
      increased dramatically.<br />
      The second area of improvement in password cracking is in the use of
      sophisticated algorithms to generate potential password.<br />
      But the best results have been achieved by studying examples of actual
      passwords in use. To develop techniques that are more efficient and
      effective than simple dictionary and brute-force attacks, researchers and
      hackers have studied the structure of passwords.<br />
      Using large dataset of leaked passwords as training data, a paper reports
      on the development of a probabilistic context-free grammar for password
      cracking. In this approach, guesses are ordered according to their
      likelihood, based on the frequency of their character-class structures in
      the training data, as well as the frequency of their digit and symbol
      substrings. This approach has been shown to be efficient in password
      cracking.
    </p>
    <h4 id="password-file-access-control">Password File Access Control</h4>
    <p>
      One way to thwart a password attack is to deny the opponent access to the
      password file. If the hashed password portion of the file is accessible
      only by a privileged user, then the opponent cannot read it without
      already knowing the password of a privileged user. Often, the hashed
      passwords are kept in a separate file from the user IDs, referred to as a
      shadow password file. Special attention is paid to making the shadow
      password file protected from unauthorized access. Although password file
      protection is certainly worthwhile, there remain vulnerabilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many systems are susceptible to unanticipated break-ins. A hacker may be
        able to exploit a software vulnerability in the operating system to
        bypass the access control system long enough to extract the password
        file.
      </li>
      <li>
        An accident of protection might render the password file readable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of the users have accounts on other machines in other protection
        domains, and they use the same password.
      </li>
      <li>
        A weakness in physical security may provide opportunities for a hacker.
        Sometimes, there is a backup to the password file on an emergency repair
        disk or archival disk. Access to this backup enables the attacker to
        read the password file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of capturing the system password file, another approach to
        collecting user IDs and passwords is through sniffing network traffic.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus, a password protection policy must complement access control measures
      with techniques to force users to select passwords that are difficult to
      guess.
    </p>
    <h4 id="password-selection-strategies">Password Selection Strategies</h4>
    <p>
      Our goal is to eliminate guessable passwords while allowing the user to
      select a password that is memorable. Four basic techniques are in use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        User education: this strategy is unlikely to succeed at most
        installations, particularly where there is a large user population or a
        lot of turnover. Perhaps a good technique for choosing a password is to
        use the first letter of each word of a phrase.
      </li>
      <li>
        Computer-generated passwords: it also have problems. In general,
        computer-generated password schemes have a history of poor acceptance by
        users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reactive password checking: it is a strategy in which the system
        periodically runs its own password cracker to find guessable passwords.
        The system cancels any passwords that are guessed and notifies the user.
        This tactic has a number of drawbacks. First, it is resource intensive
        if the job is done right. Furthermore, any existing password remain
        vulnerable until the checker finds them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complex password policy (or proactive password checker): it is a
        promising approach for improved password security. In this scheme, a
        user is allowed to select his or her own password. However, at the time
        of selection, the system checks to see if the password is allowable and,
        if not, rejects it. The trick with a proactive password checker is to
        strike a balance between user acceptability and strength. If the system
        uses some simple algorithm to define what is acceptable, this provides
        guidance to password crackers to refine their guessing technique.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="rule-enforcement">Rule Enforcement</h5>
    <p>
      The first approach is a simple system for rule enforcement. NIST SP
      800-63-2 suggests the following alternative rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Password must have at least sixteen characters (basic16).</li>
      <li>
        Password must have at least eight characters including an uppercase and
        lowercase letter, a symbol, and a digit. It may not contain a dictionary
        word (comprehensive8).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although this approach is superior to simply educating users, it may not
      be sufficient to thwart password crackers. This scheme alerts cracker as
      to which password not to try, but may still make it possible to do
      password cracking.<br />
      The process of rule enforcement can be automated by using a proactive
      password checker, such as the openware pam_passwdqc, which enforces a
      variety of rules on passwords and is configurable by the system
      administrator.
    </p>
    <h5 id="password-checker">Password Checker</h5>
    <p>
      Another possible procedure is simply to compile a large dictionary of
      possible &quot;bad&quot; passwords. When a user selects a password, the
      system checks to make sure that it is not on the disapproved list. There
      are two problems with this approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Space: the dictionary must be very large to be effective.</li>
      <li>
        Time: the time required to search a large dictionary may itself be
        large.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="33-token-based-authentication">3.3 Token-Based Authentication</h3>
    <p>
      Objects that a user possesses for the purpose of user authentication are
      called tokens.
    </p>
    <h4 id="memory-cards">Memory Cards</h4>
    <p>
      Memory cards can store but not process data. There are also memory cards
      that include an internal electronic memory.<br />
      Memory cards can be used alone for physical access, such as a hotel room.
      For authentication, a user provides both the memory card and some form of
      password or PIN. A typical application is an ATM. An adversary must gain
      physical possession of the card (or be able to duplicate it) plus must
      gain knowledge of the PIN. Among the potential drawbacks NIST SP 800-12
      notes the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Requires special reader: this increases the cost of using the token and
        creates the requirement to maintain the security of the reader's
        hardware and software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Token loss: a lost token temporarily prevents its owner from gaining
        system access. Thus, there is an administrative cost in replacing the
        lost token. In addition, if the token is found, stolen, or forged, then
        an adversary need only determine the PIN to gain unauthorized access.
      </li>
      <li>
        User dissatisfaction: although users may have no difficulty in accepting
        the use of a memory card for ATM access, its use for computer access may
        be deemed inconvenient.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="smart-cards">Smart Cards</h4>
    <p>
      A wide variety of devices qualify as smart tokens. These can be
      categorized along four dimensions that are not mutually exclusive:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Physical characteristics: smart tokens include an embedded
        microprocessor.
      </li>
      <li>
        User interface: manual interfaces include a keypad and display for
        human/token interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Electronic interface: a smart card or other token requires an electronic
        interface to communicate with a compatible reader/writer. A card may
        have one or both of the following types of interface:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contact: a contact smart card must be inserted into a smart card
            reader with a direct connection to a conductive contact plate on the
            surface of the card (typically gold plated).
          </li>
          <li>
            Contactless: a contactless card requires requires only close
            proximity to a reader. Both the reader and the card have an antenna,
            and the two communicate using radio frequencies.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Authentication protocol: the purpose of a smart token is to provide a
        means for user authentication. We can classify the authentication
        protocols used with smart tokens into three categories:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Static: with a static protocol, the user authenticates himself or
            herself to the token then the token authenticates the user to the
            computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dynamic password generator: in this case, the token generates a
            unique password periodically. This password is then entered into the
            computer system for authentication, either manually by the user or
            electronically via the token.
          </li>
          <li>
            Challenge-response: in this case, the computer system generates a
            challenge, such as a random string of numbers. The smart token
            generate a response based on the challenge.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For user authentication, the most important category of smart token is the
      smart card, which has the appearance of a credit card, has an electronic
      interface, and may use any of the type of protocols just described.<br />
      A smart card contains within it an entire microprocessor, including
      processor, memory, and I/O ports. Some versions incorporate a special
      co-processing circuit for cryptographic operation to speed the task of
      encoding and decoding messages or generating digital signatures to
      validate the information transferred.<br />
      A typical smart card includes three types of memory:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Read-only memory (ROM), which stores data that does not change during
        the card's life, such as the card number and the cardholder's name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), which holds application
        data and programs, such as the protocols that the card can execute. It
        also holds data that may vary with time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Random access memory (RAM), which holds temporary data generated when
        applications are executed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each time the card is inserted into a reader, a reset is initiated by the
      reader to initialize parameters such as clock value. After the reset
      function is performed, the card responds with answer to reset (ATR)
      message. This message defines the parameters and protocols that the card
      can use and the functions it can perform. The terminal may be able to
      change the protocol used and other parameters via a protocol type
      selection (PTS) command. The card's PTS response confirms the protocols
      and parameters to be used. The terminal and card can now execute the
      protocol to perform the desired application.

    <h3 id="34-biometric-authentication">3.4 Biometric Authentication</h3>
    <p>
      A biometric authentication system attempts to authenticate an individual
      based on his or her unique physical characteristics. These include static
      and dynamic characteristics. In essence, biometrics is based on pattern
      recognition. Compared to password and tokens, biometric authentication is
      both technically more complex and expensive.
    </p>
    <h4 id="physical-characteristics-used-in-biometric-applications">
      Physical Characteristics Used in Biometric Applications
    </h4>
    <p>
      A number of different types of physical characteristics are either in use
      or under study for user authentication. The most common are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Facial characteristics: they are the most common. The most common
        approach is to define characteristics based on relative location and
        shape of key facial features. An alternative approach is to use an
        infrared camera to produce a face thermogram that correlates with the
        underlying vascular system in the human face.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fingerprints: they have been used as a mean of identification for
        centuries, and the process has been systematized and automated
        particularly for law enforcement purposes. Fingerprints are believed to
        be unique across the entire human population. In practice, automated
        fingerprint recognition and matching system extract a number of features
        from the fingerprint for storage as a numerical surrogate for the full
        fingerprint pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hand geometry: it identify features of the hand, including shape, and
        length and widths of fingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Retinal pattern: it is the pattern formed by veins beneath the retinal
        surface. It is unique and therefore suitable for identification.
      </li>
      <li>Iris: the detailed structure of the iris.</li>
      <li>
        Signature: each individual has a unique style of handwriting and this is
        reflected especially in the signature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Voice: voice patterns are more closely tied to the physical and
        anatomical characteristics of the speaker. Nevertheless, there is still
        a variation from sample to sample over time from the same speaker,
        complicating the biometric recognition task.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="operation-of-a-biometric-authentication-system">
      Operation of a Biometric Authentication System
    </h4>
    <p>
      Each individual who is to be included in the database of authorized users
      must first be enrolled in the system. For a biometric system, the user
      presents a name and, typically, some type of password or PIN to the
      system. At the same time, the system senses some biometric characteristic
      of this user. The system digitizes the input then extracts a set of
      features that can be stored as a number or set of numbers representing
      this unique biometric characteristic; this set of numbers is referred to
      as the user's template. The user is now enrolled in the system, which
      maintains for the user a name (ID), perhaps a PIN or password, and the
      biometric value.<br />
      Depending on application, user authentication on a biometric system
      involves either verification or identification. Verification is analogous
      to a user logging on to a system by using a memory card or smart card
      coupled with a password or PIN. For biometric verification, the user
      enters a PIN and also uses a biometric sensor. The system extracts the
      corresponding feature and compares that to the template stored for this
      user. If there is a match, then the system authenticates this user.<br />
      For an identification system, the individual uses the biometric sensor but
      presents no additional information. The system then compares the presented
      template with the set of stored templates. If there is a match, then this
      user is identified.
    </p>
    <h3 id="35-remote-user-authentication">3.5 Remote User Authentication</h3>
    <p>
      The simplest form of user authentication is local authentication. The more
      complex case is that of remote user authentication, which takes place over
      the Internet, a network, or a communications link. Remote user
      authentication raises additional security threats, such as an eavesdropper
      being able to capture a password, or an adversary replaying an
      authentication sequence that has been observed.<br />
      To counter threats to remote user authentication, systems generally rely
      on some form of challenge-response protocol.
    </p>
    <h4 id="password-protocol">Password Protocol</h4>
    <p>
      For example, a user first transmits his or her identity to the remote
      host. The host generates a random number

      the password but a hash code of the password. This secures the password
      from intruders into the host system. In addition, not even the hash of the

      3.6 Security Issues for User Authentication
    </h3>
    <p>
      As with any security service, user authentication, particularly remote
      user authentication, is subject to a variety of attacks. The following
      list summarizes the principal attacks on user authentication:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Client attack:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Description: those in which an adversary attempts to achieve user
            authentication withouts access to the remote host or to the
            intervening communications path. The adversary attempts to
            masquerade as a legitimate user. One way to thwart such an attack is
            to select a password that is both lengthy and unpredictable (large
            entropy).
          </li>
          <li>
            Authenticators:
            <ul>
              <li>

            Description: eavesdropping in the context of passwords refers to an
            adversary's attempt to learn the password by observing the user,
            finding a written copy of the password, or some similar attack that
            involves the physical proximity of user and adversary. Another form
            of eavesdropping is keystroke logging (keylogging). For a token, an
            analogous threat is theft of the token or physical copying of the
            token. The analogous threat for a biometric protocol is copying or
            imitating the biometric parameter so as to generate the desired
            template.

    <h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
    <p>Two definitions of access control are useful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        NISTIR 7298 defines access control as the process of granting or denying
        specific request to:
        <ol>
          <li>
            obtain and use information and related information processing
            servers
          </li>
          <li>enter specific physical facilities.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        RFC 4949 defines access control as a process by which use of system
        resources is regulated according to a security policy and is permitted
        only bu authorized entities according to that policy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="41-access-control-principles">4.1 Access Control Principles</h3>
    <p>
      In a broad sense, all of computer security is concerned with access
      control.<br />
      Indeed, RFC 4949 defines computer security as follows: measures that
      implement and assure security services in a computer system, particularly
      those that assure access control service.
    </p>
    <h4 id="access-control-context">Access Control Context</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to access control, this context involves the following
      entities and functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authentication: verification that the credentials of a user or other
        system entity are valid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Authorization: the granting of a right or permission to a system entity
        to access a system resource.
      </li>
      <li>
        Audit: an independent review and examination of system records and
        activities in order to test for adequacy of system controls, to ensure
        compliance with established policy and operational procedures, to detect
        breaches in security, and to recommend any indicated changes in control,
        policy, and procedures.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An access control mechanism mediates between a user and system resources.
      The system must first authenticate an entity seeking access. Then the
      access control function determines if the specific requested access by
      this user is permitted. An auditing function monitors and keeps a record
      of user accesses to system resources.<br />
      A number of components may cooperatively share the access control
      function.
    </p>
    <h4 id="access-control-policies">Access Control Policies</h4>
    <p>
      An access control policy dictates what types of access are permitted,
      under what circumstances, and by whom. Access control policies are
      generally grouped into the following categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discretionary access control (DAC): controls access based on the
        identity of the requestor and on access rules stating what requestors
        are allowed to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mandatory access control (MAC): controls access based on comparing
        security labels with security clearances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Role-based access control (RBAC): controls access based on the roles
        that users have within the system and on rules stating what accesses are
        allowed to users in given roles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attribute-based access control (ABAC): controls access based on
        attributes of the user, the resource to be accessed, and current
        environmental conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DAC is the traditional method of implementing access control. MAC is a
      concept that evolved out of requirement for military information security
      and is best covered in the context of trusted system. Both RBAC and ABCAC
      have become increasingly popular.<br />
      These four policies are not mutually exclusive. An access control
      mechanism can employ two or even all three of these policies to cover
      different classes of system resource.
    </p>
    <h3 id="42-subject-objects-and-access-rights">
      4.2 Subject, Objects, and Access Rights
    </h3>
    <p>The basic elements of access control are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Subject: a subject is an entity capable of accessing objects. Generally,
        the concept o subject equates with that of process. Basic access control
        system typically define three classes of subject, with different access
        rights for each class:
        <ul>
          <li>Owner: this may be the creator of a resource, such as a file.</li>
          <li>
            Group: a named group of users may also be granted access rights. In
            most schemes, a user may belong to multiple groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            World: users who are not included in the categories owner and group.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        An object is a resource to which access is controlled. In general, an
        object is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. The
        number and types of objects to be protect by an access control system
        depends on the environment in which access control operates and the
        desired tradeoff between security and complexity, processing burden and
        ease of use.
      </li>
      <li>
        An access right describes the way in which a subject may access an
        object. Access rights could include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Read;</li>
          <li>Write;</li>
          <li>Execute;</li>
          <li>Delete;</li>
          <li>Create;</li>
          <li>Search.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="43-discretionary-access-control">
      4.3 Discretionary Access Control
    </h3>
    <p>
      A discretionary access control scheme is one in which an entity may be
      granted access rights that permit the entity, by its own volition, to
      enable another entity to access some resource. A general approach to DAC
      is that of an access matrix. The access matrix concept was formulated by
      Lampson and refined by Graham and Denning and by Harrison et al..<br />
      One dimension of the matrix consists of identified subject that may
      attempt data access to the resources. The other dimension lists the
      objects that may be accessed. Each entry in the matrix indicates the
      access rights of a particular subject for a particular object.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, an access matrix is usually sparse and is implemented by
      decomposition in one of two ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matrix may be decomposed by columns, yielding access control lists
      (ACLs). For each object, an ACL list users and their permitted access
      rights. The ACL may contain a default, or public, entry. This allows users
      that are not explicitly listed as having special rights to have a default
      set of rights. The default set of rights should always follow the rule of
      least privilege or read-only access, whichever is applicable. ACLs are
      convenient, because each ACL provides the information for a given
      resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decomposition by rows yields capability tickets. A capability ticket
      specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user. Each
      user has a number of tickets and may be authorized to loan or give them to
      others. Because tickets may be dispersed around the system, they present a
      greater security problem than access control lists. The integrity of the
      ticket must be protected, and guaranteed. In particular, the ticket must
      be unforgeable. These tickets would have to be held in a region of memory
      inaccessible to users. Another alternative is to include an unforgeable
      token in the capability.<br />
      This form of capability ticket is appropriate for use in a distributed
      environment, when the security of its contents cannot be guaranteed. The
      convenient aspects of capability tickets are that it is easy to determine
      the set of access rights that a given user has.
    </p>
    <p>
      A paper proposes a data structure that is not sparse, like the access
      matrix, but is more convenient than either ACLs or capability lists. An
      authorization table contains one row for one access right of one subject
      to one resource.
    </p>
    <h3 id="44-example-unix-file-access-control">
      4.4 Example: Unix File Access Control
    </h3>
    <p>
      All types of UNIX files are administered by the operating system by means
      of inodes. An inode (index node) is a control structure that contains the
      key information needed by the operating system for a particular file.
      Several file names may be associated with a single inode, but an active
      inode is associated with exactly one file, and each file is controlled by
      exactly one inode.<br />
      Directories are structured in a hierarchical tree. A directory is simply a
      file that contains a list of file name plus pointers to associated inodes.
      Thus, associated with each directory is its own inode.
    </p>
    <h4 id="traditional-unix-file-access-control">
      Traditional UNIX File Access Control
    </h4>
    <p>
      Most UNIX systems depend on the file access control scheme introduced with
      the early version of UNIX. Each UNIX user is assigned a unique user ID. A
      user is also a member of a primary group, and possibly a number of other
      groups, each identified by a group ID. When a file is created, it is
      designated as owned by a particular user. It also belongs to a specific
      group, which initially is either its creator's primary group, or the group
      of its parent directory.<br />
      Associated with each file is a set of 12 protection bits. The owner ID,
      group ID, and protection bits are part of the file's inode. Nine of the
      protection bits specify read, write, and execute permission for the owner
      of the file, other members of the group to which this file belongs, and
      all other users. These form a hierarchy of owner, group, and all others,
      with the highest relevant set of permissions being used.<br />
      When applied to a directory, the read and write bits grant the right to
      list and to create/rename/delete files in the directory. The execute bit
      grants the right to descend into the directory or search it for a
      filename.<br />
      The remaining three bits define special additional behaviour for files or
      directories. Two of these are SetUID and SetGID permissions. If those
      permission are set, it happens that when a user (with execute privileges
      for this file) executes the file, the system temporarily allocates the
      rights of the user's ID of the file creator, or the file's group,
      respectively, to those of the user executing the file. These are known as
      the &quot;effective user ID&quot; and &quot;effective group ID&quot; and
      are used in addition to the &quot;real user ID&quot; and &quot;real group
      ID&quot; of the executing user when making access control decisions for
      this program. This change is only effective while the program is being
      executed. It enables users to access certain files in a controlled
      fashion.<br />
      The final permission bit is the &quot;sticky&quot; bit. When applied to a
      directory it specifies that only the owner of any file in the directory
      can rename, move, or delete that file. This is useful for managing files
      in shared temporary directories.<br />
      One particular user ID is designated as &quot;superuser&quot;. The
      superuser is exempt from the usual file access control constraints and has
      system-wide access. Great care is needed when writing such programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This access scheme is adequate when file access requirements align with
      users and a modest number of groups of users. If there are a large number
      of different grouping of users requiring a range of access rights to
      different files, then a very large number of groups may be needed to
      provide this. This rapidly become unwieldy and difficult to manage, if
      event possible at all. One way to overcome this problem is to use access
      control lists, which are provided in most modern UNIX systems.
    </p>
    <h4 id="access-control-lists-in-unix">Access Control Lists in UNIX</h4>
    <p>
      Many modern UNIX and UNIX-based operating systems support access control
      lists. The feature is referred to as extended access control list, while
      the traditional UNIX approach is referred to as minimal access control
      list.<br />
      FreeBSD allows teh administrator to assign a list of UNIX user IDs and
      groups to a file by using the
      <em>setfacl</em> command. Any number of users and groups can be associated
      with a file, each with three protection bits (read, write, execute),
      offering a flexible mechanism for assigning access rights. FreeBSD files
      include an additional protection bit that indicates whether the file has
      an extended ACL.<br />
      FreeBSD and most UNIX implementations that support extended ACLs use the
      following strategy:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The owner class and other class entries in the 9-bit permission field
        have the same meaning as in the minimal ACL case.
      </li>
      <li>
        The group class entry specifies the permissions for the owner group for
        this file. These permissions represent the maximum permissions that can
        be assigned to named users or named groups, other than the owning user.
        In this latter role, the group class entry functions as a mask.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional named users and named groups may be associated with the file,
        each with a 3-bit permission field. The permissions listed for a named
        user or named group are compared to the mask field. Any permission for
        the named user or name group that is not present in the mask field is
        disallowed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When a process requests access to a file system object, two steps are
      performed:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Selects the ACL entry that most closely matches the requesting process.
        Only a single entry determines access.
      </li>
      <li>
        Checks if the matching entry contains sufficient permissions. A process
        can be a member in more than one group; so more than one group entry can
        match. If any of these matching group entries contain the requested
        permissions, one that contains the requested permissions is picked.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="45-role-based-access-control">4.5 Role-Based Access Control</h3>
    <p>
      RBAC is based on the roles that users assume in a system rather than the
      user's identity. Typically, RBAC models define a role as a job function
      within an organization. RBAC systems assign access rights to roles instead
      of individual users. In turn, users are assigned to different roles,
      either statically or dynamically, according to their responsibilities.<br />
      The relationship of users to roles is many to many.<br />
      The set of roles in the system in most environments is relatively static,
      with only occasional additions or deletions. Each role will have specific
      access rights to one or more resources.<br />
      We can use the access matrix representation to depict the key elements of
      an RBAC system in simple terms. Each matrix entry is either blank or
      marked, the latter indicating that this user is assigned to this role.
      Note a single user may be assigned multiple roles and multiple users may
      be assigned to a single role. Note a role can be treated as an object,
      allowing the definition of role hierarchies.<br />
      RBAC lends itself to an effective implementation of the principle of least
      privilege. Each role should contain the minimum set of access rights
      needed for that role.

      The many to many relationships between users and roles and between roles
      and permissions provide a flexibility and granularity of assignment not
      found in conventional DAC schemes. Without this flexibility and
      granularity, there is a greater risk that a user may be granted more
      access to resources than is needed because of the limited control over the
      types of access that can be allowed.

      Role hierarchies provide a means of reflecting the hierarchical structure
      of roles in an organization. Role hierarchies make use of the concept of
      inheritance to enable one role to implicitly include access rights
      associated with a subordinate role. One role can inherit access rights
      from multiple subordinate roles. More than one role can inherit from the
      same subordinate role.

      Constraints provide a means of adapting RBAC to the specifics of
      administrative and security policies in an organization. A constraint is a
      defined relationship among roles or a condition related to roles. A paper
      lists the following types of constraints:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mutually exclusive roles: they are roles such that a user can be
          assigned to only one role in the set. The mutually exclusive
          constraint supports a separation of duties and capabilities within an
          organization. This separation can be reinforced or enhanced by use of
          mutually exclusive permission assignments. With this additional
          constraint, a mutually exclusive set of roles has the following
          properties:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A user can only be assigned to one role in the set;</li>
          <li>
            Any permission (access right) can be granted to only one role in the
            set.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Thus, the set of mutually exclusive roles have non overlapping
          permissions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cardinality: it refers to setting a maximum number with respect to
          roles. One such constraint is to set a maximum number of users that
          can be assigned to a given role.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prerequisite roles: specified by the system, they dictate a user can
          only be assigned to a particular role if it is already assigned to
          some other specified role. A prerequisite can be used to structure the
          implementation of the least privilege concept.

    <h3 id="t1---exposed-attack-surface-nmap">
      T1 - Exposed attack surface (nmap)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Every host that is connected to a network has an exposed attack surface.
      Even if there are no active services that are accepting requests from the
      network, there is always a protocol stack that performs many complex
      operations on the inbound packets that are received from the network. Very
      often, an online host also provides services that can be accessed from the
      network. Being able to precisely determine the exposed attack surface of
      the hosts in our organization is a basic network security procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The network mapper (<code>nmap</code>) is an open source tool that has
      been specifically designed for discovering the host/devices that are
      connected in a specific network and to probe their exposed attack surface.
      It is possible to perform the discovering using various protocols, like
      ICMP or TCP-SYN.<br />
      Example command: <code>sudo nmap -sn -v 192.168.1.0/24</code> (use ICMP),
      <code>sudo nmap -sS -v 192.168.1.0/24</code> (use TCP).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many tools have been implemented for executing a network discovery.
      <code>netdiscover</code> is another relevant one. Example command:
      <code>sudo netdiscover -i &lt;network_device&gt; -p</code>, in this case
      the network discovery procedure is passive. This means that we are not
      probing the target devices sending packets on the network but only
      listening on the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finding one or more hosts to which we are interested for a deeper
      analysis, we can revert to nmap for performing a port scanning of such
      devices. Now, we are interested in finding what services are listening to
      network sockets and are accessible from outside the specific host.<br />
      We start by using a feature of nmap that is often able to determine what
      OS (and version) is running on the chosen device:
      <code>sudo nmap -O &lt;ip_host_address&gt;</code>. We can use
      <code>sudo nmap -sT &lt;ip_host_address&gt;</code> to perform host
      scanning with the TCP protocol (or
      <code>sudo nmap -sU &lt;ip_host_address&gt;</code> for UDP). We can add
      <code>-p0-65535</code> argument to scan all the existing ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nmap has a modular structure that is used for integrating adjunctive
      components. For example, it is possible to enable the execution of one or
      more scripts that are specifically designed for finding vulnerabilities in
      the software installed on the targe machine. A typical example is the
      &quot;vuln&quot; script that is part of the standard nmap distribution:
      <code>sudo nmap --script vuln -v &lt;ip_host_address&gt;</code>, it
      inspect the services running on the machine and likely some known
      vulnerabilities have been reported.<br />
      Another script, much more aggressive, is:
      <code>sudo nmap -Pn --script ssh-brute -v &lt;ip_host_address&gt;</code>
      which uses a brute-force attack on a exposed service (i.e. ssh). In other
      words, it tries often used combinations of username and password.
    </p>
    <h3 id="t2---des-and-aes-encryption-using-openssl">
      T2 - DES and AES encryption using OpenSSL
    </h3>
    <p>
      In GNU/LINUX, encrypting a text using the DES cipher is very easy. In
      fact, it is sufficient to use the implementation provided by the OpenSSL
      software tool.<br />
      Example command:
      <code
        >openssl enc -e -des -salt -in plaintext.txt -out ciphertext.bin -pass
        pass:cybersecurity</code
      >, we obtain a new binary file that contains the ciphered text.<br />
      We can decrypt using
      <code
        >openssl enc -d -des -in ciphertext.bin -out plaintext2.txt -pass
        pass:cybersecurity</code
      >
      and we can verify if the file is byte-to-byte identical with plaintext.txt
      <code>diff plaintext2.txt plaintext.txt</code>.<br />
      It is useful to perform encryption in parallel for reducing the amount of
      time needed for encrypting a file.
    </p>
    <h3 id="t3---practical-dictionary-attack-to-the-symmetric-encryption">
      T3 - Practical dictionary attack to the symmetric encryption
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let's suppose that an attacker has been able to intercept and record a
      message that has been encrypted using a symmetric block cipher. And assume
      that the attacker knows the specific cipher used for encrypting the
      message and the different encryption parameters. In practice, the whole
      security (i.e. confidentiality) of the transmission is based on a strong
      cipher and the confidentiality of the symmetric encryption key.<br />
      The command used by the sender to encrypt the message is:
      <code
        >openssl enc -e -aes-256-cbc -iter 1 -md sha512 -in plaintext.txt -out
        ciphertext.bin -pass pass:&lt;password&gt;</code
      >. Note that use a password for getting a key is called
      <em>derivation</em>. In the command, the hash function &quot;hash512&quot;
      is run a single time.<br />
      The approach followed by the attacker to break the encryption is to try
      all the possible keys. This operation must be done considering two
      important aspects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        avoid false negative: a specific word is tried but not detected as the
        correct key for decrypting the message;
      </li>
      <li>
        minimize or avoid false positives: a word that is unable to decrypt the
        message in the correct plaintext is reported as correct.
      </li>
    </ul>

      The first attempt produce a result that is not what we expected. That's
      because of the semantics of the errors reported by OpenSSL. It returns an
      error only if there is an alignment problem of the generated output with
      respect to the expected output (i.e., the different output sizes differ).
      In practice, brute-forcing a message encrypted by using OpenSSL and
      following this approach would generate a relevant number of false
      positives. Verify that using the second approach.

    <h3 id="t4---usage-examples-of-gpg">T4 - Usage examples of GPG</h3>
    <p>
      GPG (GnuPG) us a complete implementation of the OpenPGP standard for
      sending and receiving secure emails. GPG implements both symmetric and
      asymmetric encryption ciphers and it is typically used for encrypting
      email but it can be also used for encrypting generic input files.<br />
      The first step is about generating a new couple of keys for an identity:
      <code>gpg --gen-key</code>. The default parameters used are fair but they
      can be tuned. After some time, the keys are generated and then tagged with
      a specific identifier. It is possible to list all the public (<code
        >gpg --list-public-keys</code
      >) or private (<code>gpg --list-private-keys</code>) keys that are stored
      in our system.<br />
      Just after creating the new key-pair, it's important to generate and
      secure the corresponding revocation certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make available to the public the public-key we can use various systems.
      For example we can publish a text file in a website (<code
        >gpg --export -a &lt;Key-ID&gt; &gt; mykey.asc</code
      >) or we can use a key server (<code
        >gpg --send-keys --keyserver &lt;KEY_SERVER&gt; &lt;KEY_ID&gt;</code
      >). A key server is an infrastructure that is specifically dedicated to
      the publication of public keys and their management. Obviously it possible
      to query the key server for finding already existing public keys (<code
        >gpg --search-keys &lt;EMAIL_LINKED_TO_KEY&gt;</code
      >) and we can import that public key to our keyring.<br />
      Assuming we imported the key linked to the email &quot;foo@bar.xy&quot;,
      we can encrypt a document that needs to be delivered in a confidential way
      to the owner of the public key:
      <code>gpg --encrypt --recipient 'foo@bar.xy' foo.txt</code>. If it's not
      important to hide the content of the message but only to authenticate its
      originator we use
      <code>gpg --output foo.txt.sig --sign foo.txt</code>.<br />
      It is also possible to combine both operations to get CIA:
      <code>gpg --encrypt --sign --recipient 'foo@bar.xy' foo.txt</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="web-of-trust">Web-of-Trust</h4>
    <p>
      Consider the problem related to the authenticity of the public-key that we
      used for encrypting our message to preserve confidentiality. The mechanism
      that is typically used by gpg is called <em>web-of-trust</em>. The basic
      idea of the web-of-trust is that after carefully checking the identity of
      the people that we know (in real life) and their matching with their
      corresponding public-key,, then we can validate this match by signing
      their public-key (using our private-key). In practice, signing a key of
      someone has the effect of extending our web-of-trust and moreover, maybe
      we can accept to trust someone that is unknown to us that has been
      validated by one or more friends of ours.<br />
      Since it results quite uneasy to bring with us the printed version of our
      public-key it is preferred to use the fingerprint (<code
        >gpg --fingerprint &lt;KEY_ID&gt;</code
      >). The procedure is as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        print out on paper the fingerprint and the identifier of the public-key;
      </li>
      <li>
        provide all that to the person that is willing to sign our public key;
      </li>
      <li>
        get the key to be signed using
        <code
          >gpg --keyserver &lt;keyserver&gt; --recv-keys &lt;Keys_ID&gt;</code
        >;
      </li>
      <li>
        after a final check to verify the information, proceed with key
        signature using <code>gpg --sign-key &lt;KEY_ID&gt;</code>;
      </li>
      <li>
        propagate the signing operation to a key server to build a public
        web-of-trust using
        <code>gpg --keyserver &lt;keyserver&gt; --send-key &lt;KEY_ID&gt;</code
        >.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It is possible to list all the signature that have been collected by a
      specific public-key using <code>gpg --list-sigs &lt;KEY_ID&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-gpg-for-symmetric-encryption">
      Using GPG for symmetric encryption
    </h4>
    <p>
      GPG also implements some symmetric ciphers, for example use
      <code>gpg --output foo.txt.gpg --symmetric foo.txt</code> to encrypts an
      input file using the default symmetric cipher provided by GPG. The
      different ciphers can be listed with <code>gpg --version</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="age">AGE</h4>
    <p>

    <h3 id="t5---example-of-pharming-attack-to-http-and-https">
      T5 - Example of pharming attack to HTTP and HTTPS
    </h3>
    <h4 id="attacking-http">Attacking HTTP</h4>
    <p>
      The general structure of the attack is composed of the following steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        cloning of the pages of the target website + implementing local
        modifications;
      </li>
      <li>
        setup of a fake HTTP server that is used to service the pages requested
        by the victim web browser;
      </li>
      <li>
        redirections of the request made by the web browser to the fake HTTP
        server.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The first two points are simple, the third point is the core of the
      attack. This redirection can be implemented in many different ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the typical attack pattern is about modifying the DNS host addresses
        provided by the router to the hosts in the local network. In fact, the
        DHCP protocol is not only responsible to provide an IP address to every
        host that is newly connect to the network but also to provide some basic
        communication parameters such as the IP addresses of the DNS servers and
        the IP address of the default gateway;
      </li>
      <li>by modifying the default gateway;</li>
      <li>
        installation, by the attacker, of a rogue DHCP server that provides
        forged parameters to the clients entering the network. This would be
        typically combined with a DoS attack to the legitimate DHCP server to
        slow it down (or stop) its execution;
      </li>
      <li>
        modifying the content of the &quot;/etc/hosts&quot; file that is used by
        the local DNS resolver (only for single host attack);
      </li>
      <li>configuration of (transparent) HTTP proxies;</li>
      <li>
        modification of some specific information (e.g. the destination IP
        address) on the packers in the communication flow, using specific tools
        that operate at the kernel level such as <code>iptabled</code> and
        <code>nftables</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="attacking-https">Attacking HTTPS</h4>
    <p>
      The main difference between HTTPS and HTTPS is the usage of an encrypted
      communication protocol based on TLS. The goal of TLS is to provide
      confidentiality, integrity and also authenticity to the data stream.<br />
      For a pharming attack over the HTTPS protocols, the three steps above are
      not sufficient. It is also necessary to assume the compromission of the
      SSL/TLS certificate.<br />
      Since it is possible, but very unlikely, that an attacker is able to
      compromise a CA then we will assume that the compromission will be only
      local. The best possibility for the attacker is to attack the integrity of
      the web browser used by the victim. Also in this case, there are many
      possible avenues of attack but the simplest consists of adding a new host
      certificate to the list of trusted certificates recognized by the browser.
      Note that operation does not need any special execution privilege.
    </p>
    <h4 id="revocation-of-certificates">Revocation of Certificates</h4>
    <p>
      A final point that must be considered is the violation of the certificate
      authority (it does not happen very often). When it happens, all the
      certificates that have been issued by the CA with the compromised private
      key must be revoked as soon as possible. The mechanism for the certificate
      revocation must be implemented in all browser and in all the libraries
      that make use of encrypted communications that are based on TLS.

    <h3 id="t6---offline-password-cracking-using-john-the-ripper-jtr">
      T6 - Offline password cracking using John the Ripper (JtR)
    </h3>
    <p>
      John the Ripper (JtR) is one of the most famous tool for password
      cracking. Its cracking efficiency depends on many factors such as the
      execution architecture that is available (e.g., CPU vs GPU) and it is full
      of useful functionalities.<br />
      JtR is open source and freeware, but it also offer a pro version.<br />
      First of all download and compile JtR (wget [source.tar.gz] -&gt; tar xvzf
      [source.tar.gz] -&gt; cd [source_dir] -&gt; make [architecture_target]).
      The scripts will be in john_dir/run directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a working instance of JtR, we can verify the strength of the
      passwords that are used in a specific system.<br />
      In all modern UNIx-like systems the information about the users is split
      between two different files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the first file contains the usernames and some ancillary information
        about users (readable by all users);
      </li>
      <li>
        the second file contains the salted and hashed passwords (readable only
        with privileges).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      JtR requires inputting a single file with all the information described
      above. This can be easily done using a tool bundled with it:
      <code>./unshadow &lt;PASS_FILE&gt; &lt;SHADOW_FILE&gt; passwd.1</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      JtR is a complex tool with many functionalities, the simples way to use it
      is the <em>single crack</em> mode: <code>./john --single passwd.1</code>.
      Using this mode, JtR tries to guess the passwords using only the
      information that is available in the input file and adding only a limited
      amount of common variations. This is a very quick approach that can guess
      only very weak password.<br />
      A more complex approach is the usage of a <em>wordlist</em> (e.g. a
      dictionary): <code>./john --wordlist=password.lst --rules passwd.1</code>.
      The <code>password.lst</code> file is given by JtR but it is possible to
      use other and custom wordlists. A bit more advanced mode combines the
      usage of the wordlist with a set of rules for the variations of the words
      included in the list:
      <code>./john --wordlist=password.lst --rules passwd.1</code>. Another
      approach is called <em>incremental</em> and it is based on an exhaustive
      search of all the possible password. Even a brute-force attack can be
      conducted smartly. For example, it is possible to choose the frequency of
      characters based on the language typically used by the attacked users. The
      command is: <code>./john --incremental passwd.1</code>.<br />
      When the execution is finished, all the recovered passwords can be found
      with
      <code>./john passwd.1 -show</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="pdf-cracking">PDF cracking</h4>
    <p>
      JtR can be also used to verify the quality of passwords used to protect
      pdf documents, but JtR is unable to work directly on pdf files so the
      first step is to extract the hashed password that is contained in each pdf
      file: <code>./pdf2john &lt;filename&gt;.pdf hash.txt</code>. The obtained
      hash code can now be processed by JtR:
      <code>./john --format=pdf hash.txt</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="gpu-based-cracking-of-passwords">
      GPU-based cracking of passwords
    </h4>
    <p>
      GPUs are execution architectures that often permit a relevant speedup in
      the execution of password cracking if compared with CPUs. The structure of
      the problem is quite good for parallelization and the modern GPUs often
      implement (in hardware) the main encryption ciphers. JtR has limited GPU
      support, and more appropriate tools are available for password cracking on
      GPU, for example Hashcat.
